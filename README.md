# SKSE/commonlibsse-ng Template Repo

Taking inspiration from [SkyrimScripting Templates](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Templates), this is my custom repository template for creating my own plugins

This repo has been customised from [SkyrimScripting Multiple Source and Headers Template](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_MultipleSourceAndHeaderFiles) The original readme from that can be found in [Original Readme](ORIG_README.md)

## Customisation

Once a repository has been created from the template, you will need to do the following

* Update PROJECT_NAME on line 6 of [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
* Create your plugin :)
